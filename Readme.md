This is the machine unlearning project performed on the MNIST dataset. The comparison between the performance metrices of learning and unlearning has been analysed using various techniques or approaches. For learning, I have used a logistic regression model implemented using TensorFlow and for unlearning, naive retraining, influence
function-based unlearning, SISA (Sharded, Isolated, Sliced,and Aggregated) unlearning approaches are used. Additionally, we apply a voting classifier that combines the outcomes of these three methods to evaluate their combined effectiveness. 

I assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, among other important performance parameters, to reveal subtle variations in performance as well as computing efficiency and flexibility in dynamic data contexts.
